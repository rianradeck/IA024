 'Theranostics has been applied in oncology, contributing to new approaches in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancers. By integrating diagnostic imaging and targeted therapies, theranostics offers personalized approaches that improve treatment outcomes and patient care. In oncology, theranostics encompasses a wide range of applications, including the management of various types of cancers such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enable the visualization and characterization of cancerous lesions, aiding in early detection, staging, and assessment of treatment response. This allows for more accurate and tailored treatment planning, including the selection of appropriate targeted therapies or the optimization of radiation therapy.

 'The WHO projects that climate change will also affect infectious disease occurrence. It is projected that interspecies viral sharing, that can lead to novel viral spillovers, will increase due to ongoing climate change-caused geographic range-shifts of mammals (most importantly bats). Risk hotspots would mainly be located at ""high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa"". A 2016 study reviews literature on the evidences for the impact of climate change on human infectious disease, suggests a number of proactive measures for controlling health impacts of climate change and finds that climate change impacts human infectious disease via alterations to pathogen, host and transmission.'
 ""Another way climate change may affect pandemic risks, is by pathogens in thawing permafrost (e.g. in the Arctic) that may have infected now-extinct ancestral humans in such regions. However, a scientist concluded that probably permafrost per se shouldn't host more pathogens than any other environment. Nevertheless, the risk from permafrost pathogens is unknown and viruses from the very first humans to populate the Arctic could emerge.
